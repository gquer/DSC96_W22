# Project: Sleep

This week focuses on health data, and in particular sleep data downloaded from an app.

We will start by looking at what is the potential of this data and why it is important. We will then look in particular at how to analyze this data and what information can we extract from it. We'll do the work for one subject, while potentially this can be extended to a large population. 

By the end of this section you will:

* Know how a particular type of health data (sleep data) looks like 
* Transform the downloaded data into data that we can analyze
* Examine three different source for the same data, and compare their precision

Your task today:
* We need to compare sensor 1 and sensor 2 to the gold standard!
* Enter the folder of the sensor assigned to you (sensor 1 or sensor 2)
* Complete the sensorX_analysis_ipynb
* Generate the hypnogram ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnogram ) for the day of interest and only considering 7 hours (from 11pm to 6am), with one value every 30 seconds
* Put it in the correct format (you have an example in sensor1/sensor_RAND_output.csv) so it will be easy to compare the sensors at the end!
