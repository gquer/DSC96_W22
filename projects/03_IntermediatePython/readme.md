# Intermediate Python

This folder has some workbooks that are meant to help you level up in areas that I think are important for data science.  We will be using some of these concepts later in class, so it is a good idea to review them if you aren't already pretty comfortable.
This is going to be very useful as a reference point for you to code in python.

Here is what is covered:

## Data Structures
(at least until Dictionaries, we will use them in this class, so check them out today)

* List comprehensions
* Randomness
* Tuples
* Sets
* Dictionaries
* Zip, map, filter and enumerations
* Functions as values
* Lambda functions
* Sorting

## Pandas

This covers the syntax for typical data manipulation, but also introduces handy ways to explore data sets.  For a quick reference I really like Vicki Boykis's [Cheat Sheet of Useful Pandas Idioms](https://github.com/veekaybee/til/blob/master/python/pandas_cheat_sheet.md).

## Numpy

This one is really short, and is actually about array indexing.  It pays special attention to logical indexing and multi-dimensional arrays.
